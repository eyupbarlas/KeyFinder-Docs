# KeyFinder Telegram Bot Activation Guide
## Steps
### Step 0
Download **Telegram** to your smartphone(Android, iOS) to get notifications from KeyFinder. 
### Step 1
* First of all, open Telegram app and start the conversation with **BotFather** (@BotFather). BotFather will help us in creating the new bot.
  - Search for @botfather in Telegram.

   ![botfather search](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72407947/146800108-96ffb18b-f71a-41fc-bb34-caa19a195267.png)

  - Start your conversation by pressing the Start button.
 
   ![start bot](https://ucarecdn.com/ca311d0a-e460-43b9-aaf6-9b97a549a9cf/)
    
   - Create the bot by running /newbot command.

   ![newbot](https://ucarecdn.com/93c96757-1522-4062-a141-3530a56f66f2/)
    
   - Enter the Display Name and User Name for the bot. Later on you can customise the way you want, but before enter these two names.

   - BotFather will send you a message with the token.
   
   ![token http_api](https://ucarecdn.com/a6a0a74c-e40c-4c8b-9d4c-28c602f4af7c/)
   
* Save that token to send to the KeyFinder team. Do not share with anyone!
* Then you should follow the link that BotFather sent you to go to your bot(like *t.me/tutorial_echobot*).
* When you get to your bot, press the start button.

### Step 2
* Secondly, we need to get our **ChatID**. To get that, we need to open Telegram app and start the conversation with **RawDataBot** (@RawDataBot). 
  - Go to the search icon.

  - Type "**@RawDataBot**" in the search dialog box and search.

  ![search bot](https://i1.wp.com/www.alphr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-30.jpg?w=720&ssl=1)
  
  - Select "**Telegram Bot Raw**" from the search results.
  
  ![select bot](https://i1.wp.com/www.alphr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/3-31.jpg?w=720&ssl=1)
  
  - Start your conversation by pressing the Start button.

  ![start bot](https://i2.wp.com/www.alphr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/4-28.jpg?w=720&ssl=1)
  
  - You’ll get another message containing your First Name, Last Name, and Chat ID. Find “Chat” from the list of information.

  ![data return](https://i1.wp.com/www.alphr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/5-16.jpg?w=720&ssl=1)
  
  - Under “Chat,” you’ll see a number. It’s marked with the word “id” on the right-hand side. That’s your **Chat ID** number.
  
  ![chatid](https://i1.wp.com/www.alphr.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/6-15.jpg?w=720&ssl=1)
  
* After that, save that **ChatID** to send to the KeyFinder team. Do not share with anyone!
